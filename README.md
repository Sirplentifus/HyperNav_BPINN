# Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks

## :pushpin: Requirements
- `python` version 3.9.* (download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- `virtualenv` version 20.14.* (download from [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html#via-pip))

## :gear: Installation 
### Windows
1. Go into the directory of your project with `cd project_folder_path`
2. Create an empty *virtual environment* with `py -m venv .\my_env_name`
3. Enter into the virtual environment with `my_env_name\scripts\activate`
4. Check that the environment is empty with `pip freeze`; normally, it should print nothing
5. Install the required packages from the `.txt` file `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run again `pip freeze` and check that the environment is no longer empty
7. Add the environment folder to your `.gitignore` (in order to avoid pushing the packages on git!)

To exit from the virtual environment, use `deactivate`
### Mac and Linux
1. Go into the directory of your project with `cd project_folder_path`
2. Create an empty *virtual environment* with `virtualenv .\my_env_name`
3. Enter into the virtual environment with `source my_env_name\bin\activate`
4. Check that the environment is empty with `pip freeze`; normally, it should print nothing
5. Install the required packages from the `.txt` file `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run again `pip freeze` and check that the environment is no longer empty
7. Add the environment folder to your `.gitignore` (in order to avoid pushing the packages on git!)
