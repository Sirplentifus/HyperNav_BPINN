# Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks

## Requirements :memo:
- `python` version 3.9.* (download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- `virtualenv` version 20.14.* (download from [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html#via-pip))

## Installation :computer:
### Windows :national_park:	
1. Go into the directory of your project with `cd project_folder_path`
2. Create an empty *virtual environment* with `python -m virtualenv .\my_env_name`
3. Enter into the virtual environment with `my_env_name\scripts\activate`
4. Check that the environment is empty with `pip freeze`; normally, it should print nothing
5. Install the required packages from the `.txt` file `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run again `pip freeze` and check that the environment is no longer empty
7. Add the environment folder to your `.gitignore` (in order to avoid pushing the packages on git!)

To exit from the virtual environment, use `deactivate`
### Mac :apple: and Linux :penguin:

## Project status :sad:
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
